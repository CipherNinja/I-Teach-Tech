# ✈️ Aircraft Maintenance Logs Dataset

## 📘 About the Dataset

This dataset is derived from the **MaintNet** project and contains detailed aircraft maintenance logs. Each entry includes free-text descriptions of:

- **Problems** encountered during aircraft operation or inspection
- **Fixes** or actions taken to resolve those issues

The dataset is designed to support research in **predictive maintenance**, **natural language processing**, and **aviation safety analytics**.
