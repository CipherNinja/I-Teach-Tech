# ‚úàÔ∏è Aircraft Maintenance Log Analysis: Fuel System Risk Detection

This project focuses on identifying and analyzing fuel system-related risks in aircraft maintenance logs. Inspired by recent incidents such as the AI171 crash in Gujarat (June 2025), the goal is to detect patterns that may indicate high-risk fuel system failures ‚Äî especially those that could lead to engine shutdown or hydraulic loss.

---

## üîç Objective

- Detect and flag fuel system-related issues using keyword-based analysis.
- Analyze co-occurrence with critical failure events like engine shutdown and RAT (Ram Air Turbine) deployment.
- Lay the foundation for predictive modeling of high-risk maintenance scenarios.

---

## üß† Fuel System Keywords

The following keywords are used to identify potential fuel-related risks:

```
fuel, cutoff, switch, valve, supply, shut, block, clog, pressure, flow, injector, line
```

These keywords are matched using regex patterns to capture variations (e.g., `shut`, `shutdown`, `shutting`, etc.).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Steps

### 1. Preprocessing

- Convert all `PROBLEM` descriptions to lowercase.
- Remove irrelevant columns (e.g., `IDENT`) to focus on issue content.

### 2. Fuel Risk Flagging

Create a new column `FUEL_RISK_FLAG`:
- Value `1` if any fuel-related keyword is found in the `PROBLEM` text.
- Value `0` otherwise.

```python
import re

fuel_keywords = ['fuel', 'cutoff', 'switch', 'valve', 'supply', 'shut', 'block', 'clog', 'pressure', 'flow', 'injector', 'line']
pattern = re.compile(r'\b(' + '|'.join(fuel_keywords) + r')\b')

df['FUEL_RISK_FLAG'] = df['PROBLEM'].apply(lambda x: 1 if pattern.search(str(x).lower()) else 0)
```

---

## üìä Failure Pattern Detection

Analyze the frequency and context of fuel-related issues:

- Count how often each fuel keyword appears.
- Detect co-occurrence with critical failure indicators:
  - `engine shutdown`
  - `rat deployment`
  - `hydraulic loss`

Use visualizations such as:

- Bar charts for keyword frequency
- Heatmaps for co-occurrence patterns
- Time series plots (if `DATE` column is available)

---

## üìà Future Scope

- Severity scoring based on failure language (`rupture`, `burst`, `shutdown`, etc.)
- Predictive modeling to classify logs into risk levels
- Integration with real-time alert systems for maintenance crews

---

## üß™ Sample Output

| PROBLEM Description | FUEL_RISK_FLAG |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Fuel injector line leaking near valve | 1 |
| Engine running rough after startup | 0 |
| Fuel cutoff switch malfunction | 1 |
