Problem: Advanced Dataset Transformation with Decorators
Scenario: Employee Performance and Salary Analysis
You are a data engineer at a company tasked with analyzing employee performance and salary data.
The dataset contains employee details such as their name, department, age, salary, and performance score.
Your task is to write a set of functions that process this data using advanced Python techniques such as map(),
filter(), reduce(), and comprehensions.

However, the company wants to add extra functionality using decorators for logging, validation, and performance benchmarking.

Task:
Write a function analyze_employees that:

Filters out employees with a performance score below a certain threshold.
Calculates a 10% salary hike for employees who pass the threshold.
Returns a summary of employees including their names, updated salaries, and departments.
Use decorators to:

Log: Log the execution details (function name, arguments, and execution time).
Validate: Ensure that the input dataset is a list of dictionaries and that required keys exist.
Benchmark: Measure the time taken for execution.
Requirements:
Use map(), filter(), and list comprehensions inside the function to perform the transformations.
Use Pythonâ€™s advanced decorator features (like closures and nested decorators) to implement the decorators.

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
[LOG] Function: analyze_employees
[LOG] Arguments: [{'name': 'Alice', 'department': 'HR', 'age': 30, 'salary': 50000, 'performance': 85}, {...}], performance_threshold=80
[LOG] Result: [{'name': 'Alice', 'department': 'HR', 'updated_salary': 55000.0}, ...]

Execution Time: 0.0012 seconds
[{'name': 'Alice', 'department': 'HR', 'updated_salary': 55000.0}, {'name': 'Charlie', 'department': 'Finance', 'updated_salary': 66000.0}, {'name': 'Eva', 'department': 'Sales', 'updated_salary': 88000.0}]
