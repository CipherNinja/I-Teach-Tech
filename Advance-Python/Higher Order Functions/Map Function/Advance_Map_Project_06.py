# Scenario 3: Textual Data Normalization
# Story: As a data engineer at a publishing house, you're handling a list of book titles with inconsistent formattingâ€”some are in uppercase, some in lowercase, and others have irregular spacing. Your objective is to standardize these titles to title case (where the first letter of each word is capitalized) and remove any leading or trailing whitespace.

# Challenge: Apply the map() function to clean and standardize the list of book titles.

# Hint: Combine string methods like strip() and title() within a function, and use map() to apply this function to the list of titles.

'''
This dataset contains challenging cases, such as:

1. Titles entirely in uppercase.
2. Titles entirely in lowercase.
3. Titles with irregular spacing (e.g., leading/trailing spaces, multiple spaces between words).
4. Mixed cases.

Task:
Normalize all book titles to title case (capitalize the first letter of each word).
Remove leading/trailing whitespace and fix irregular spacing.

Explanation:
strip():

Removes leading and trailing whitespace from the title.
title():

Converts the title to title case, where the first letter of each word is capitalized.
map():

Applies the cleaning function (strip() + title()) to every title in the dataset.
list():

Converts the map object into a list for further processing or display.
